<h1>Contact Us Form with CAPTCHA</h1>

This README file provides instructions on how to set up and use a simple contact us form with CAPTCHA. This form can be integrated into your website to allow visitors to contact you while preventing spam submissions. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A server-side scripting language (e.g., PHP) for form submission handling.
- A web server to host your website.

## Installation

1. Download the necessary files:
   - HTML file: `contact.html`
   - CSS file: `style.css`
   - JavaScript file: `script.js`
   - Server-side script: `contact.php` (to handle form submissions)

2. Place the downloaded files in the appropriate directories on your web server.

## Configuration

1. Open `contact.html` file in a text editor.

2. Update the form action URL in the `<form>` tag to point to your server-side script:
   ```html
   <form action="path_to/contact.php" method="POST">
   ```

3. Configure the form fields as needed. You can add or remove fields based on your requirements:
   ```html
   <input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
   <input type="email" name="email" id="email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
   <textarea name="message" id="message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
   ```

4. Optionally, modify the CAPTCHA settings in `script.js` file:
   ```javascript
   const captchaConfig = {
     captchaUrl: 'path_to/captcha.php',
     captchaInput: 'captcha_input',
     captchaImage: 'captcha_image'
   };
   ```

5. Save the changes made to the files.

## Usage

1. Deploy your website with the updated contact form files to your web server.

2. Visitors can now use the contact form on your website to send messages to you. The form will validate the fields and require users to complete the CAPTCHA before submission.

3. Form submissions will be sent to `contact.php`, where you can handle the data using your server-side scripting language. Customize `contact.php` to process the form data, send emails, store data in a database, etc.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the server-side script `contact.php` is properly secured to prevent malicious activity.

- You can customize the appearance of the form by modifying the CSS in `style.css`.

- The CAPTCHA functionality helps to prevent spam submissions by confirming that the user is human. You may need to create a separate PHP script (`captcha.php`) to generate and validate the CAPTCHA.

- It's recommended to add server-side validation in `contact.php` to ensure the data submitted through the form is valid and safe.

- Consider implementing measures to protect your server from potential attacks or abuse, such as rate limiting or IP blocking.
